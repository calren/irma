This is an Android app that lets you input books you want to read so you can have an easier time chosing your next read. It also keeps track of books you're currently reading or have finished reading. It's kinda like GoodReads, except without a lot of the features. My motivation for building it is mostly to have an interesting Android app I can play around with for development.

Oftentimes, I browse monthly 'Best Books' list and think, "That sounds super interesting! I'd read it!". However, given that these lists always come out on the first of each month, there usually aren't ratings or reviews to give some sort of signal whether this is worth my time. 

#### App Goals
- Keep track of books user may want to read in the future
    - Pulls rating from GoodReads and Amazon (if possible)
    - Keeps track of date added
    - Notifies user when this book has crossed `x` number of reviews with `y` rating. Or when the book reaches a top seller list?

- Displays Books of the Month from:
   - Book of the Month club
   - Amazon Books of the Month
   - Book Clubs
   - Green Apple Book Store, Powell Book Store?
   
- Keep track of books + pages read per year
    
Future goals:
- Keeps track of books currently being read
- Keeps track of finished books
- Input favorite quotes

#### Learning Goals

- Kotlin
- Android app architecture
- Building Backends with Firebase
- ML Kit APIs
